# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub.

I'm starting my journey of learning (more, again) how to code. I'm not completely new; I had a two-course sequence of Java in college, and I also used MATLAB a lot then, too.

I work at a digital marketing agency, and my main goal is to learn JavaScript to write, edit, and customize AdWords scripts.

Oh yeah, I'm also going through The Odin Project.
